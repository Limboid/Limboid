# Power System

## Description

Charge, retain, and deliver 5V and high voltage 1kW direct current

## Composition

## Production

## Interfaces

- Charger port: geometry defined in power system and accommodated by skeletal system in skull
- Internal connection terminals at the 5V and high voltage supplies make it very simple for the signal system to tap in an indefinate number of lines
- Battery and buck regulator temperatures are monitored by externally mounted temperature sensors defined by signal system
