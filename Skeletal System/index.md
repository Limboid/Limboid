# Skeletal System

## Description

An assembly of geometric parts providing structural support. Actuated by muscular system

## Composition

### Description Format

We hesitate using the term "bone" because they achieve in one unified piece what it takes multiple parts to do. Many parts in the skeleton may be grouped as belonging to a subassembally while some are shared between multiple subassemballies. Most of these subassemballies are the articulations in the skeleton; although some are rigid subassemballies like the head. An example of a part shared between multiple subassemballies would be the femur which is serves both the hip articulation and knee articulation. We draft each of these subassemballies in a separate CAD file. Multi-subassembally parts, being the minority, are simply drafted in both files.

### Subassemballies

- head
- 

### Multi-subassembally parts

- L/R femur
- L/R 


## Production


## Interfaces

- ligaments connect muscles to bones and are defined in the muscular system. However in some very small parts, care is taken to ensure there is a suitable attatchment site on the geometric surface of skeletal parts.
- most systems nonintrusively secure themselves on the skeleton
- fingertip cavities of fixed size host whatever sensors the signal system would like to squeeze in. while cavity deminsions are defined in the skeletal system, sensors embedded there are defined in the signal system.
- The head accomodated many electrical components. These are first defined in the signal or power systems. Then room is made in the skull to host these demands and best route a forced convection heat sink. These components are:
	- charger
	- 2 USB ports
	- micro SD slot
	- power button
	- eyes
	- ears
	- screen
	- speaker
	- computer
	- brain board
	- overheating temperature sensors
	- environmental field sensors
- The hydraulic system connects at the input and output ports for the skull's convection heat sink flow. The flexible tube delivering this flow is defined by the hydraulic system. Built in internal skull barbs and glue fix the tubes in place.
- The integumentary system stops at the base of the skull where its termination ring directly screws into the skull. Pitch, diameter and other details are defined in the skeletal system skull and conformed to by the integumentary system.
- Gloss and finish applied to skull (if any) is defined by the integumentary system.
