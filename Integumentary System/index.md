## Interfaces

- skull termination ring: belongs to and defined in integumentary system but screws onto skull at 3 locations
- hands: care is taken in glove selection to not significantly diminish tactile sensitivity
- major skin: in most places, provides some internal pressure on muscles, but still significantly less than their forces
