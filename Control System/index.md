Limboid machine control system

## Composition
## Production
## Interfaces

It's hard to follow the template at this plane in the design. The control system is its own system of systems and no one approach may necesarily be best. See [github.com/Limboid](https://github.com/Limboid) or [limboid.ai](https://limboid.ai) for the latest control systems.
